**Data Analysis and Visualization for Airline Revenue Optimization**

**Business Problem :** Spearheaded an analysis project to address the challenges faced by the airline industry, including stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased labor costs, and fluctuating fuel prices, which were impacting profitability.

**Data Cleansing and Multilingual Data Handling:** Cleaned and processed multilingual data to extract relevant information. Utilized Python and SQL to ensure that only understandable data was retained for further analysis.

**Aircraft and Airport Data Analysis:** Extracted insights from aircraft and airport data, including aircraft models, seating capacities, and airport names, to inform business decisions.

**Aircraft Seating Capacity Analysis:** Identified aircraft with more than 100 seats, crucial for optimizing routes and flight scheduling. Visualized results to provide clear insights into seating capacity.

**Aircraft Code to Model Mapping:** Successfully derived aircraft names from their codes, enhancing data interpretability.

**Ticket Booking Trends:** Analyzed ticket booking data over time, highlighting trends in the number of tickets booked and their correlation with revenue earned.

**Revenue Analysis:** Examined the distribution of fares for flights, enabling the airline to optimize pricing strategies for different fare classes.

**Occupancy Rate Analysis:** Calculated and analyzed the average occupancy rate per aircraft, identifying opportunities for increasing occupancy and, consequently, revenue.

**Revenue Growth Strategy:** Proposed a strategy to increase the average occupancy rate by 10%, leading to a substantial boost in total annual turnover.

**Data Visualization:** Employed data visualization techniques, including line charts and bar plots, to present key findings effectively to stakeholders.

**Impact on Profitability:** Demonstrated how data-driven insights and recommendations can contribute to profitability by optimizing pricing, occupancy rates, and revenue streams.

**Skills Utilized:** Proficiently used Python, SQL, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and data manipulation techniques to conduct comprehensive data analysis and visualization.
